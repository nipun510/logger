# logger
Simple and fast logger

## Desired features of a logging system
1. A configurable option for other application modules to save logs at more than one platform like, on Console, in txt files or 
   on network etc.
2. A Facility to log messages in different categories like, ERROR, WARNING, GENERAL_MESSAGES and also provision to control 
   each category independently.
3. A Facility to configure & bind category and logging platform at run time i.e. user will be able to specify at runtime 
   ie messages of any particular category should be logged or not etc. Messages of any particular category like ERROR should 
   be logged in error.txt and remaining categories on console only etc.
 4. Thread safety.
